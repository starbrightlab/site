# Testing Guidelines: Starbright Lab Website

This document outlines the testing approach for the Starbright Lab website to ensure that it meets the retro-futurist design mandate, mobile-first principles, performance targets, and accessibility requirements.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Visual Design Testing

#### Aesthetic Integrity

- **Color Palette**: Verify all colors match the defined palette in the Design System document.
- **Typography**: Confirm font usage follows the typography guidelines (Pacifico for script headings, Space Grotesk for sans-serif text).
- **Component Styling**: Ensure all components adhere to the retro-futurist design specifications.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Check that the visual hierarchy enhances the retro-futurist theme.

#### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-First Verification**: Test design implementation starting from smallest screens.
- **Breakpoint Testing**: Verify appropriate layouts at each breakpoint (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl).
- **Touch Targets**: Confirm all interactive elements have minimum 44Ã—44px touch targets.
- **Spacing Consistency**: Verify spacing follows the specified rhythm (multiples of 4 or 8px).

### 2. Functional Testing

#### Component Functionality

- **Interactive Elements**: Test all buttons, links, and interactive components.
- **Animation Behavior**: Verify animations function as expected and respect reduced motion preferences.
- **Navigation**: Ensure header, menu, and internal links work correctly.
- **Form Validation**: When implemented, test form inputs and validation behavior.

#### Cross-Browser Compatibility

Test on the following browsers:
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

#### Device Testing

Test on the following devices:
- Mobile phones (iOS, Android)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Desktop/laptop computers
- Various screen sizes and pixel densities

### 3. Performance Testing

#### Core Web Vitals

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Target under 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Target under 100 milliseconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Target under 0.1

#### Page Load Performance

- **Initial Payload Size**: Verify under 200KB for critical rendering path
- **Image Optimization**: Check image sizes and formats
- **Script Execution Time**: Monitor JavaScript execution

#### Animation Performance

- **Animation FPS**: Target 60fps on high-end devices, minimum 30fps on low-end
- **Battery Impact**: Test animation behavior on mobile devices
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for potential memory leaks

### 4. Accessibility Testing

#### WCAG Compliance

- **Color Contrast**: Verify minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all functionality using keyboard only
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test with VoiceOver (Mac/iOS) and NVDA (Windows)
- **Focus Management**: Verify visible focus indicators

#### Motion Sensitivity

- **Reduced Motion**: Test with prefers-reduced-motion media query
- **Animation Control**: Verify ability to pause or disable animations
- **Flash Thresholds**: Ensure no content flashes more than three times per second

#### Content Structure

- **Semantic HTML**: Verify proper use of HTML elements
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Confirm logical heading structure
- **Landmark Regions**: Check appropriate use of landmark roles
- **Alternative Text**: Ensure all non-text content has text alternatives

## Testing Methods

### Manual Testing

#### Visual Inspection

- Create a visual testing checklist for each component
- Compare implementation against design specifications
- Review on multiple devices and screen sizes

#### User Scenarios

Test common user journeys:
1. Navigate to each section from the homepage
2. Interact with all buttons and links
3. Complete any forms (when implemented)
4. Test error states and edge cases

### Automated Testing

#### Unit Testing

Implement Jest and React Testing Library for:
- Component rendering verification
- Props and state management
- Event handling

#### End-to-End Testing

Consider implementing Cypress or Playwright for:
- Complete user flows
- Cross-browser testing
- Visual regression testing

#### Performance Testing

- Lighthouse for Core Web Vitals
- WebPageTest for more detailed performance metrics
- Custom performance monitoring for animations

## Testing Environments

### Development

- Local testing during development
- Browser DevTools for responsive testing
- Accessibility browser extensions

### Staging

- Deployed test environment
- Cross-browser and cross-device testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Production

- Final verification in production environment
- Ongoing monitoring
- Real user metrics

## Accessibility Testing Tools

- Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools)
- axe DevTools (browser extension)
- WAVE Evaluation Tool
- Screen readers: VoiceOver (Mac/iOS), NVDA (Windows)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Color contrast analyzers

## Performance Testing Tools

- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest
- Chrome DevTools Performance panel
- Core Web Vitals report
- Custom FPS counter for animation testing

## Test Documentation

### Test Cases

For each component, document:
- Expected visual appearance
- Expected behavior
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance expectations
- Edge cases to test

### Bug Reporting

When reporting issues:
1. Clearly describe the issue
2. Include steps to reproduce
3. Specify browser/device information
4. Include screenshots or recordings
5. Reference specific design/technical requirements

### Regression Testing

After fixes:
1. Verify the specific issue is resolved
2. Check for any related functionality
3. Ensure no new issues were introduced

## Continuous Testing

As development progresses:
1. Test each new component as it's created
2. Conduct regular full-site testing
3. Update test cases as requirements evolve

## Testing Priorities

When conducting tests, follow this hierarchy of concerns:
1. Retro-futurist aesthetic integrity
2. Mobile usability and experience
3. Performance and loading speed
4. Accessibility compliance
5. Browser compatibility
6. Desktop enhancements

This aligns with the decision-making framework specified in the project instructions.

## Conclusion

Thorough testing is essential to ensure the Starbright Lab website successfully implements the retro-futurist design mandate while maintaining a high standard of usability, performance, and accessibility. By following these guidelines, we can identify and address issues throughout the development process and deliver a polished final product.
