# Next Conversation Prompt for Starbright Lab Website Development

I would like to continue developing the Starbright Lab website, focusing on the next steps outlined in our project documentation. The repository is located at: `/Users/andrewlawson/development/starbrightlab-site`.

## Current Status

We've successfully set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, implemented core UI components following our retro-futurist design system, and created the homepage with basic animations and responsive design. All of this aligns with our project's design mandate of embodying 1950s retro-futurism inspired by "Hello Tomorrow!"

## Next Development Focus

Based on our `next-steps.md` document, I'd like to focus on:

1. **Developing the About Page**:
   - Create a new page that showcases the company history, mission, and our team
   - Implement the timeline component with retro-futurist design elements
   - Add team member cards with orbital animations as specified in our animation guidelines

2. **Enhancing Interactions and Animations**:
   - Add more sophisticated animations including parallax effects
   - Implement scroll-based interactions for background elements
   - Create radar rings and orbital patterns as decorative elements

I'd like you to help me:
1. Implement the About page structure and components
2. Create the timeline component with appropriate styling and animations
3. Design team member cards with orbital animations
4. Add sophisticated scroll-based interactions
5. Ensure all new elements maintain the retro-futurist aesthetic while being responsive and accessible

Please refer to our extensive project documentation in the `/docs` folder, particularly:
- `design-system.md` for visual styling guidance
- `animations.md` for animation specifications
- `components.md` for component implementation details
- `content-strategy.md` for tone and messaging

For content on the About page, please suggest copy that aligns with our retro-futurist voice and tone as specified in the content strategy document. The page should communicate a sense of optimism, forward-thinking vision, and space-age terminology while being clear and professional.

I'd like to continue using the same development approach with mobile-first design and maintaining accessibility standards throughout.
